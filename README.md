# Project_2_R
In this project, we are creating code that will help us analyze data to answer a scientific question.

### My Scientific Question
Where in the Black Perigord truffle's (*Tuber melanosporum*) GSE49700 gene series is there the most similar gene sequence between the fruit body stage and free-living mycelium stage, compared to enzymes that are involved as well, and what can this tell us about the truffle's characteristics?

### My Scientific Hypothesis
If there is a similar sequence found in both the FM and FLM stages that align with the sequence of a specific enzyme that is involved with the truffle's volatility, then the specific sequence identified has the most impact on the truffle's aroma.

### Files Used
1) To obtain the data used for this project, txt files were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) from an experiment that involved performing whole-genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing on the different developmental stages of *T. melanosporum* (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49700). The specific file that was used is named "GSE49700_FB_FLM.RNA.txt" and it lists measured data, such as methylation patterns, of each gene involved that could be compared.
2) The second set of data files used was obtained from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FN430075). Here specifically, a FASTA file of the truffle's nucleotide sequence was downloaded called "sequence.fasta"--this analysis could help answer my scientific question regarding the gene sequence.
