# Project_2_R
In this project, we are creating code that will help us analyze data to answer a scientific question.

### My Scientific Question
Where in the Black Perigord truffle's (*Tuber melanosporum*) GSE49700 gene series is there the most similar gene sequence between the fruit body stage and free-living mycelium stage, compared to enzymes that are involved as well, and what can this tell us about the truffle's characteristics?

### My Scientific Hypothesis
If there is a similar sequence found in both the FM and FLM stages that align with the sequence of a specific enzyme that is involved with the truffle's volatility, then the specific sequence identified has the most impact on the truffle's aroma.

### Files Used
1) To obtain the data used for this project, txt files were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) from an experiment that involved performing whole-genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing on the different developmental stages of *T. melanosporum* (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE49700). The specific file that was used is named "GSE49700_FB_FLM.RNA.txt" and it lists integers of each gene involved that could be compared. The second set of data files used was obtained from the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FN430075). Here specifically, a FASTA file of the truffle's nucleotide sequence was downloaded called "sequence.fasta"--this analysis could help answer my scientific question regarding the gene sequence.
